nachtigal
variable based programming language, kind of just an interpreter but not

installation
currently still in development so there is nothing really to install.
currently manual, you can build with make, but you have to copy the lib manually
    to /usr/include/
Will be installed as <nachtigal> to system. File extension will be <.nagl> and
    source code will be installed to system so that the user can edit and change
    the code as wanted.
