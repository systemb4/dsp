# Linear Data Sorting Library
currently in development\

Should this work with something like json, yaml, etc. or a custom format?\
Should this also be able to just take long list of data in?

## todo
* change to a lib and be able to make as many ll's as user wants with different
  head names
* change node name to nodeLinkedList and nick-name to node
* search should take in word; check for value with spaces or : or , on either side
    if value is word return what it is : to or the opposite
* Number of elements
* number of definitions
* documentation of each function
* documentation of how it works
