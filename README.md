# Data Sorting and Processing Library in C
currently in development

## installation
currently manual, you can build with make, but you have to copy the lib manually
to /usr/include/

## issues
* transfer function currently broken, compiles but returns false char's

## todo
* be able to choose a data structure based on the pattern of the input file
* sort by increaseing/decreasing number if number list
* sort by alphabetical order
* search and replace within file
* add tree structure that links linked lists
* change to a lib and be able to make as many ll's as user wants with different
  head names
* search should take in word; check for value with spaces or : or , on either side
    if value is word return what it is : to or the opposite
* Number of elements
* number of definitions
* documentation of each function
* documentation of how it works

* make compatibility for json in jsonin.h
