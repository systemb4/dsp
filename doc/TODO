function for switch statments - lexer
add comparison ops - lexer
string to double function
addDef function number or string
spaces included in lexer when going through

structure AST so that it can be more widely implementable
    be able to link more defs to name but no def should be linked to def and
    no name should be linked to def
    AST is linear sort of that it is a linked list but with multiple types to
    each node
    try to make it a tree and each head of tree is linked to each other OR the
    tree just goes down further as the code progresses

review

sort function for all of the tokens
addDef function get working
