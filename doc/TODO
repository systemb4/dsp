documentation of each function line by line comments
documentation of how it works
have a default main.c that is compiled and installed to system
fix up make file
multi-thread?
rename like all variables to something more sensible

function for switch statments - lexer
add comparison ops - lexer
string to double function
addDef function number or string
spaces included in lexer when going through


structure of final run function:
    go through definition, if it sees "" + "" then it makes a new string and sets it
        equal to that definition (wont be able to concat more than one string), maybe
        concat numbers as strings to strings?
    if sees '' + '' or '' / ''  or '' * '' or '' - '' then it will do math, order of operations
        will be difficult
    And then everything stays in memory but if I call a function like print() then it will be
        able to go back in memory, get that variable and print it, probably not be able to concat
        in the function, only when defining variables
    Maybe make new struct linked list that will take a number or string and a type op like
    (*, /, +, -) so that it can be easier to do mathematics


structure AST so that it can be more widely implementable
    be able to link more defs to name but no def should be linked to def and
    no name should be linked to def
    AST is linear sort of that it is a linked list but with multiple types to
    each node
    try to make it a tree and each head of tree is linked to each other OR the
    tree just goes down further as the code progresses

review

sort function for all of the tokens
addDef function get working
sor function works for both definitions and names
